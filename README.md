## About

This Blog webpage is build with Vuetify and Vue. Both desktop and mobile responsive.


## Usage

### Basic Usage

Clone the source files of the theme and navigate into the theme's root directory. Run `yarn` and then run `yarn dev`
which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live
reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `package.json` file to see which scripts are included.

#### Scripts
We have now switched to the Vite build tool, which is much faster.

- `yarn dev` start a vite dev server
- `yarn build` build all file to `dist`
